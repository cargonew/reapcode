**Reaping Leetcode one line at a time.**

This repo is a growing collection of my Leetcode solutions written in **Rust**. It’s part of my personal grind to master algorithms, sharpen problem-solving skills coz i currently suck. 

## 🛠️ Structure

The problems are organized into difficulty-based folders:

```
reapcode/
├── easy/
├── medium/
└── hard/
```

Each file follows this convention:

- File name: `problem_name.rs`
- Function signature and solution included
- All code is tested and formatted using `cargo fmt`

## 🚀 Running Code

Make sure you have Rust installed via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs): # Best decision you will ever make in your life.

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

To run a specific file:

```bash
cd easy   # or medium/hard
rustc two_sum.rs && ./two_sum or whatever you gonna see dude i am not a robot i make spelling mistakes that i am lazy to fix
```

> You can also load the solution into a `main.rs` and run with `cargo run`.

## 🧠 Why Rust?

Because memory safety, performance, and real devs use `cargo`( you should as well).

## 🧭 Goals

- 📅 Daily commit streak , I will try my very best( I get very lazy sometimes and end up brainrot )
- ✅ Solve at least one problem per day
- 🧪 Learn advanced patterns like DP, Graphs, and Bitwise tricks , and chad may way thru all oF DSAs.

## 📌 Note

I document my learning journey through code. All solutions are my own unless otherwise credited.

Let’s reap code — not just for the interviews, but for mastery, and fun ofcoz hahah ..
